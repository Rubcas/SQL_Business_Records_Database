# SQL_Business_Records_Database

# This database is based on a fictional company called Northwind Traders company tha imports and exports specialty foods from around the world

# The goal of this database is to generate a SQL script that creates Postgres database and populates it with database tables that are referenced on the Workshop1_ERD.png

# What I learned: SQL conventions for entity and attributes, relationships (one to one, one to many, many to many), and also the implementation of foreign keys for these different relationships.
